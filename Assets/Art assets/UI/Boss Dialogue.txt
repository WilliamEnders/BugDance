(Phone ringing...)
Boss: Ladybug, What did I told you! It's already Mid-Summer day!
You: Oh right! Umm... sorry Boss, but what did you say?
Boss: ...Our magazine needs to be published THIS weekend! Did you get ANY usable photo of bugs' dancing?!
You: (OMG I totally forgot...) 
You: For the magazine right? Oh, yeah... I've got a few...Umm... I just need another day to sort them out!
Boss: It's better be true! Send those photos to me tomorrow. Or don't even dream about your salary this month!
You: Of course, Boss! Tomorrow it is!
Boss: Good.
(Boss hung up the phone.)
You: (Better get going! Get some awesome pictures!)
